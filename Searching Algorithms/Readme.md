# Searching Algorithms 

Searching is one of the core computing algorithms which is used to retrieve the information proficiently. Searching is the process of finding
an item in a collection of items which are stored as a record in a database, array, list or as nodes or vertices. The various Search Algorithms
that have been implemented are tabulated below: 

| Implementation          | Worst Case | Average Case |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Unordered Linear Search | O(n)       | O(n/2)       |
| Ordered Linear Search   | O(n)       |              |
| Binary Search           | O(log n)   | O(log n)     |
| Interpolation Search    | n          | log(log n)   |
