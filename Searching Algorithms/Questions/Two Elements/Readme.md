# Two Elements 

Given an array of n elements, we have to find two elements in the array such that their sum is equal to a given element K. In the first method,
we will brute force the solution with O(n^2) Time Complexity while in the second method, we will implement a Binary Search variation to
bring down the Time Complexity to O(n*log n)
